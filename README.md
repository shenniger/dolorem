This project turns the idea of compile-time function execution as a metaprogramming
mechanism up to eleven.

## Overview
The idea is to have a programming language with macros are so powerful, they
can even call directly into the code generator.

Combine that with the macro-friendly S-expression syntax and you end up with a truly
programmable programming language, just like the old Lisps. Unlike the old Lisps,
though, Dolorem is statically typed and uses LLVM to compile everything to fast machine code.

## Example
```
include "def.dlr";
funproto puts (str a;) i32;
defun main () i32 {
  puts "Hello, world!";
};
```

## Macro Example
This is the current implementation of the `not` operator as a macro:
```
defun lower-not ((rtv a)) rtv
  (make-twin-rtv (LLVMBuildNot bldr (unwrap-llvm-value a) "not") a);
defmacro not
  (lower-not (eval (car args)));
```

This defines `not` as a macro, a function that is called at compile-time, that
is passed a list of arguments and that can generate code.

`not` does so by evaluating its first argument (read: generating run-time code
for evaluation of its first argument) and then calling into a regular function
called `lower-not` which calls `LLVMBuildNot` and generates type information
for the front-end.

## Dependencies
* Linux (sorry â€¦ didn't get around to porting this to anything else yet)
* Modern C/C++ compiler
* LLVM 10+

## Compiling it
Just type `make`. You may need to specify the environment variables `CC`, `CXX` and `LLVMPREFIX`.

If you encounter any compiler errors, try running `make report` or use another version of LLVM.
