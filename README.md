This project turns the idea of compile-time function execution as a metaprogramming
mechanism up to eleven.

## Overview
The idea is to have a programming language with macros which are so powerful that they
can even call directly into the code generator.

Combine that with the macro-friendly S-expression syntax and you end up with a truly
programmable programming language, just like the old Lisps.

Unlike the old Lisps, though, Dolorem is statically typed and uses LLVM so
everything compiles to machine code and you don't lose any runtime performance.

## Example
This is the current implementation of the `not` operator as a macro:
```
defun lower-not ((rtv a)) rtv
  (make-twin-rtv (LLVMBuildNot bldr (unwrap-llvm-value a) "not") a);
defmacro not
  (lower-not (eval (car args)));
```

This defines `not` as a macro, a function that is called at compile-time, that
is passed a list of arguments and that can generate code.

`not` does so by evaluating its first argument (read: generating run-time code
for evaluation of its first argument) and then calling into a regular function
called `lower-not` which calls `LLVMBuildNot` to build and generates type information
for the front-end.

## Dependencies
* Linux (sorry … didn't get around to porting this to anything else yet)
* Modern C/C++ compiler
* LLVM 10+

## Compiling it
Just type `make`. You may need to specify the environment variables `CC`, `CXX` and `LLVMPREFIX`.

If you encounter any compiler errors, try running `make report` or use another version
of LLVM.
